title: Initial conditions using PYTHIA for hydrodynamic simulations

event: XLIV Brazilian Meeting on Nuclear Physics
#event_url: https://example.org

location: Online

#summary: An example talk using Hugo Blox Builder's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "In this work, we model a nuclear collison using initial conditions based on PYTHIA-Angantyrâ€™s event generator and a hydrodynamic simulation chain for the evolution of the system. With this approach, we have a three-dimensional initial condition that is obtained via modeling of hard partonic interactions, which is more realistic than the parametric approaches used in some hybrid models. We calculate the transverse momentum distributions and the anisotropic flow obtained from these simulations and compare to data from the ALICE collaboration. We also discuss the impact of the many degrees of freedom involved in the conversion of a PYTHIA collision event into an energy-momentum tensor that serves as an initial condition for hydrodynamics."
