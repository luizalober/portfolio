abstract: "With the objective to classify the presence or ausency of metilation of an enzyme known as MGMT through mRI imaging, this work was developed using multiple neural network techniques to obtain insights on this feature.
The impact of classification, feature extraction and selection of information-rich brain areas by the network was studied, with results analysed through binary classification metrics."
