abstract: "The extreme conditions obtained when colliding ultra-relativistic heavy-ions at modern particle accelerators lead to the predicted formation of strongly interacting matter, a state of matter called a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The most common description treats the various stages of the system's evolution through different models for each step of the collision process. In these models, the system undergoes a QGP phase simulated using relativistic hydrodynamics and, after an expansion and cool-down phase, it then hadronizes via sampling of the energy-momentum hypersurface. The resulting hadrons are then still left to interact both elastically and inelastically in a hadronic phase simulated using hadron cascade models, until hadron densities are low enough that no further interactions will occur. In this work, we propose to study the elliptic flow v2 of charged particles created in Pb-Pb collisions at the energy of 2.76 TeV using a hybrid model that employs the MUSIC hydrodynamic simulator as well as UrQMD to emulate the hadronic phase. This final-state v2 will be compared to initial state conditions as well as to available experimental data from the ALICE experiment at these same energies."
