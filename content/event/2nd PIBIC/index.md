title: Elliptic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions

event: XXVII Congresso de Iniciação Científica da UNICAMP
#event_url: https://example.org

location: State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)

#summary: An example talk using Hugo Blox Builder's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "This project aims to act as an introduction to the field of high-energy particle physics through the study of theories, models and simulations used to understand experimental results from the LHC, such as event generators and simulators that reproduce heavy-ion's collision chain. Physical processes such as fragmentation and the production of jets, ultrarelativistic hydrodynamic and statistical hadronization models will be employed in this research, and the final goal is to compare those with real collision data from the ALICE collaboration."
