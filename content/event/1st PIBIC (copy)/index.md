title: Development of a Light Detector for a Low Temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscope

event: XXVI Congresso de Iniciação Científica da UNICAMP
#event_url: https://example.org

location: State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)

#summary: An example talk using Hugo Blox Builder's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: 'This project aims to implement, test and improve a light detection system that will be installed in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope operating at Low Temperatures (LT-STM). This system is made of a parabolic mirror, a converging lens and an optical fiber bundle. The challenge will be to aligning these elements with sub-micrometric precision and develop alignment protocols to align the mirror with respect to the tunnel junction. Such procedures are crucial to the Young Investigators Project that funds the purchase of the LT-STM and which the final objective is the study of the luminescence of nanostructured semiconductors.'
