## About Me

I'm currently working towards my PhD at University of São Paulo (USP, Brazil), previously having obtained my bachelor's and master's degree in physics at UNICAMP. The focus of my research, in the area of complex systems, is on characterizing non-linear dynamics through supervised models and network properties. I look forward to apply physical, statistical and data-oriented modeling to various phenomena!
