	abstract = {{Predicting and characterizing diverse non-linear behaviors in dynamical systems is a complex challenge, especially due to the inherently presence of chaotic dynamics. Current forecasting methods are reliant on system-specific knowledge or heavily parameterized models, which can be associated with a variety of drawbacks including critical model assumptions, uncertainties in their estimated input hyperparameters, and also being computationally intensive. Moreover, even when combined with recurrence analyses, these approaches are typically constrained to chaos identification, rather than parameter inference. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a methodology that uses recurrence plots to train convolutional neural networks with the task of estimating the defining control parameters of two distinct non-linear systems: (i) the Logistic map and (ii) the Standard map. By focusing on the neural networks' ability to recognize patterns within recurrence plots, we demonstrate accurate parameter recovery, achieving fairly confident levels of prediction for both systems. This method not only provides a robust approach to predicting diverse non-linear dynamics but also opens up new possibilities for the automated characterization of similar non-linear dynamical systems.}}
